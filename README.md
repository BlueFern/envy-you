Envy-You
========

Brains trust NVU1.1 model. A neurovascular coupling model combining both the Potassium/membrane voltage and the Calcium/EET pathways in the astrocyte.

Documentation
=============

LaTeX documentation is provided in the doc folder, compile main.tex to generate a PDF version.
In the figures folders 3 *.m files can be found. To change your matlab figure to a *.tikz file set matlab directory to the figures folder, and run: matlab2tikz('your_filename.tikz''height', '\figureheight', 'width', '\figurewidth') 


Citing Envy-You Code
====================

TODO: What paper?

How To Run
==========
In NVC_main.m, under parameters to adjust the model select 1 for NVU1.0 and 2 for NVU1.1. (3 and 4 respectively leave Calcium and EET out of the BK-channel open state equations in NVU1.1) 
J_PLC can be changed from 0.18 to 0.4 to simulate vasomotion. Run NVC_main.m to generate data, and plot all figures.


Input
-----

TODO: Expected input, if any?

Output
------

TODO: All figures generated by plot_all can be saved automatically (uncomment the save_all() line in NVC_main.m).
