abstract = {The relationship between blood pressure (BP) and cognitive outcomes in elderly adults has implications for global health care. Both hypertension and hypotension affect brain perfusion and worsen cognitive outcomes. The presence of hypertension and other vascular risk factors has been associated with decreased performance in executive function and attention tests. Cerebrovascular reserve has emerged as a potential biomarker for monitoring pressure-perfusion-cognition relationships. A decline in vascular reserve capacity can lead to impaired neurovascular coupling and decreased cognitive ability. Endothelial dysfunction, microvascular disease, and mascrovascular disease in midlife could also have an important role in the manifestations and severity of multiple medical conditions underlying cognitive decline late in life. However, questions remain about the role of antihypertensive therapies for long-term prevention of cognitive decline. In this Review, we address the underlying pathophysiology and the existing evidence supporting the role of vascular factors in late-life cognitive decline.},

@article{Gruetter1998,
abstract = {Understanding the mechanism of brain glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier is of importance to understanding brain energy metabolism. The specific kinetics of glucose transport have been generally described using standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics. These models predict that the steady-state glucose concentration approaches an upper limit in the human brain when the plasma glucose level is well above the Michaelis-Menten constant for half-maximal transport, Kt. In experiments where steady-state plasma glucose content was varied from 4 to 30 mM, the brain glucose level was a linear function of plasma glucose concentration. At plasma concentrations nearing 30 mM, the brain glucose level approached 9 mM, which was significantly higher than predicted from the previously reported Kt of approximately 4 mM (p < 0.05). The high brain glucose concentration measured in the human brain suggests that ablumenal brain glucose may compete with lumenal glucose for transport. We developed a model based on a reversible Michaelis-Menten kinetic formulation of unidirectional transport rates. Fitting this model to brain glucose level as a function of plasma glucose level gave a substantially lower Kt of 0.6 +/- 2.0 mM, which was consistent with the previously reported millimolar Km of GLUT-1 in erythrocyte model systems. Previously reported and reanalyzed quantification provided consistent kinetic parameters. We conclude that cerebral glucose transport is most consistently described when using reversible Michaelis-Menten kinetics.},

@article{Silver1996,
abstract = {1. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded under whole-cell voltage clamp from granule cells in slices of rat cerebellum. EPSCs from individual mossy fibre inputs were identified by their all-or-none appearance in response to a graded stimulus. Excitatory synaptic transmission was investigated at room temperature (approximately 24 degrees C) and at near-physiological temperature (approximately 34 degrees C) by analysing current fluctuations in the peak and decay of the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (non-NMDA) component of EPSCs. 2. In a subset of synapses the mean EPSC amplitude remained unchanged as the probability of transmitter release was substantially lowered by raising the extracellular Mg2+ and lowering Ca2+. These synapses were considered to have only one functional release site. Single-site synapses had small EPSCs (139 16 pS, n = 5, at 24 degrees C) with a large coefficient of variation (c.v. = 0.23 0.02, n = 5) and an amplitude distribution that was well fitted by a Gaussian distribution in four out of five cases. The EPSC latency had a unimodal distribution and its standard deviation had a temperature dependence with a temperature coefficient (Q10; range, 24-35 degrees C) of 2.4 0.4 (n = 4). 3. Peak-scaled non-stationary fluctuation analysis of single-site EPSCs indicated that the mean conductance of the underlying non-NMDA channels was 12 2 pS (n = 4) at 35 degrees C. Upper and lower limits for mean channel open probability (Po), calculated from fluctuations in the EPSC peak amplitude, were 0.51 and 0.38, respectively. These estimates, together with the open probability of the channel when bound by transmitter, suggest that only about 50\% of the non-NMDA channels were occupied following the release of a quantum of transmitter. 4. At some multi-site synapses EPSCs had a low c.v. (0.4 0.01, n = 5) at 34 degrees C and non-stationary fluctuation analysis gave a parabolic variance-mean current relationship. This suggests that practically all of the non-NMDA receptors were occupied by glutamate at the peak of EPSC. The channel open probability (Po = 0.84 0.03, n = 5) at these 'saturated' multi-site synapses will therefore equal the open probability of the channel when bound by transmitter (Po,max). 5. Non-stationary fluctuation analysis of EPSCs from 'saturating' multi-site synapses indicated that 170 40 postsynaptic non-NMDA channels were exposed to transmitter at the peak of the EPSC. The mean conductance of the synaptic channels was 10 2 pS (n = 5) at 34 degrees C. 6. At synapses with multiple release sites the EPSC decay time became faster when release probability was lowered (by reducing the external Ca2+/Mg2+ ratio), indicating that the transmitter concentration profile depended on release probability. No such speeding of the EPSC decay was observed at single-site synapses. 7. Our results suggest that release of a packet of transmitter from a single release site does not saturate postsynaptic non-NMDA receptors at cerebellar mossy fibre-granule cell synapses. However, at multi-site synapses transmitter released from neighbouring sites can overlap, changing the transmitter concentration profile in the synaptic cleft. We conclude that the level of postsynaptic receptor occupancy can depend on the probability of transmitter release at individual multi-site synapses.},

abstract = {Neural activities trigger regional vasodilation in the brain. Diffusible messengers such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostanoids are considered to work as vasodilators in neurovascular coupling. However, their roles are still controversial. In the present study, cortical images of neural activities and vasodilation were recorded through the intact skull of C57BL/6 mice anesthetized with urethane. Flavoprotein fluorescence responses elicited by vibratory hindpaw stimulation were followed by darkening of arteriole images reflecting vasodilation in the somatosensory cortex. Vasodilation was also observed in light reflection images at the wavelength of 570 nm in the same mice. We perfused the surface of the cortex under the skull with 100 microM N(G)-nitro-l-arginine (l-NA), an inhibitor of NO synthase (NOS), and 10 microM indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX). These drugs suppressed vasodilation without changing flavoprotein fluorescence responses. A mixture of l-NA and indomethacin almost completely eliminated vasodilation. In mice lacking neuronal NOS (nNOS), activity-dependent vasodilation was significantly suppressed compared with that in littermate control mice, while that in mice lacking cytosolic phospholipase A2 alpha (cPLA2alpha) was unchanged. These results indicate that NO works as a vasodilator in neurovascular coupling of the mouse somatosensory cortex.},

abstract = {Quantification of nonlinear interactions between two nonstationary signals presents a computational challenge in different research fields, especially for assessments of physiological systems. Traditional approaches that are based on theories of stationary signals cannot resolve nonstationarity-related issues and, thus, cannot reliably assess nonlinear interactions in physiological systems. In this review we discuss a new technique "Multi-Modal Pressure Flow method (MMPF)" that utilizes Hilbert-Huang transformation to quantify dynamic cerebral autoregulation (CA) by studying interaction between nonstationary cerebral blood flow velocity (BFV) and blood pressure (BP). CA is an important mechanism responsible for controlling cerebral blood flow in responses to fluctuations in systemic BP within a few heart-beats. The influence of CA is traditionally assessed from the relationship between the well-pronounced systemic BP and BFV oscillations induced by clinical tests. Reliable noninvasive assessment of dynamic CA, however, remains a challenge in clinical and diagnostic medicine.In this brief review we: 1) present an overview of transfer function analysis (TFA) that is traditionally used to quantify CA; 2) describe the a MMPF method and its modifications; 3) introduce a newly developed automatic algorithm and engineering aspects of the improved MMPF method; and 4) review clinical applications of MMPF and its sensitivity for detection of CA abnormalities in clinical studies. The MMPF analysis decomposes complex nonstationary BP and BFV signals into multiple empirical modes adaptively so that the fluctuations caused by a specific physiologic process can be represented in a corresponding empirical mode. Using this technique, we recently showed that dynamic CA can be characterized by specific phase delays between the decomposed BP and BFV oscillations, and that the phase shifts are significantly reduced in hypertensive, diabetics and stroke subjects with impaired CA. In addition, the new technique enables reliable assessment of CA using both data collected during clinical test and spontaneous BP/BFV fluctuations during baseline resting conditions.},

abstract = {The understanding of the unorthodox actions of neuronal-derived nitric oxide ((•)NO) in the brain has been constrained by uncertainties regarding its quantitative profile of change in time and space. As a diffusible intercellular messenger, conveying information associated with its concentration dynamics, both the synthesis via glutamate stimulus and inactivation pathways determine the profile of (•)NO concentration change. In vivo studies, encompassing the real-time measurement of (•)NO concentration dynamics have allowed us to gain quantitative insights into the mechanisms inherent to (•)NO-mediated signaling pathways. It has been of particular interest to study the diffusion properties and half-life, the interplay between (•)NO and O(2) and the ensuing functional consequences for regulation of O(2) consumption, the role of vasculature in shaping (•)NO signals in vivo, and the mechanisms that are responsible for (•)NO to achieve the coupling between glutamatergic neuronal activation and local microcirculation.},

abstract = {In the past two decades, over 1000 clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a benefit in treating stroke, with the exception of thrombolytics. Although many targets have been pursued, including antioxidants, calcium channel blockers, glutamate receptor blockers, and neurotrophic factors, often the focus has been on neuronal mechanisms of injury. Broader attention to loss and dysfunction of non-neuronal cell types is now required to increase the chance of success. Of the several glial cell types, this review will focus on astrocytes. Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the higher mammalian nervous system, and they play key roles in normal CNS physiology and in central nervous system injury and pathology. In the setting of ischemia astrocytes perform multiple functions, some beneficial and some potentially detrimental, making them excellent candidates as therapeutic targets to improve outcome following stroke and in other central nervous system injuries. The older neurocentric view of the central nervous system has changed radically with the growing understanding of the many essential functions of astrocytes. These include K+ buffering, glutamate clearance, brain antioxidant defense, close metabolic coupling with neurons, and modulation of neuronal excitability. In this review, we will focus on those functions of astrocytes that can both protect and endanger neurons, and discuss how manipulating these functions provides a novel and important strategy to enhance neuronal survival and improve outcome following cerebral ischemia.},

In the CNS, nitric oxide has an array of functions, such as the regulation of synaptic plasticity, the sleep-wake cycle and hormone secretion. Particularly interesting is the role of nitric oxide as a Janus molecule in the cell death or survival mechanisms in brain cells. In fact, physiological amounts of this gas are neuroprotective, whereas higher concentrations are clearly neurotoxic.},

@article{Koenigsberger2004,
abstract = {Many experimental studies have shown that arterial smooth muscle cells respond with cytosolic calcium rises to vasoconstrictor stimulation. A low vasoconstrictor concentration gives rise to asynchronous spikes in the calcium concentration in a few cells (asynchronous flashing). With a greater vasoconstrictor concentration, the number of smooth muscle cells responding in this way increases (recruitment) and calcium oscillations may appear. These oscillations may eventually synchronize and generate arterial contraction and vasomotion. We show that these phenomena of recruitment and synchronization naturally emerge from a model of a population of smooth muscle cells coupled through their gap junctions. The effects of electrical, calcium, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate coupling are studied. A weak calcium coupling is crucial to obtain a synchronization of calcium oscillations and the minimal required calcium permeability is deduced. Moreover, we note that an electrical coupling can generate oscillations, but also has a desynchronizing effect. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate diffusion does not play an important role to achieve synchronization. Our model is validated by published in vitro experiments obtained on rat mesenteric arterial segments.},

We demonstrate that the inflammatory activation of microglia serves as a key node for progressive neurodegeneration. Our analysis reveals that targeting microglia may hold potential promise in the prevention and treatment of AD.},

@article{Farr2011,
abstract = {Functional hyperemia is an important metabolic autoregulation mechanism by which increased neuronal activity is matched by a rapid and regional increase in blood supply. This mechanism is facilitated by a process known as "neurovascular coupling"--the orchestrated communication system involving neurons, astrocytes and arterioles. Important steps in this process are the production of EETs in the astrocyte and the release of potassium, via two potassium channels (BK and KIR), into the perivascular space. We provide a model which successfully accounts for several observations seen in experiment. The model is capable of simulating the approximate 15\% arteriolar dilation caused by a 60-s neuronal activation (modelled as a release of potassium and glutamate into the synaptic cleft). This model also successfully emulates the paradoxical experimental finding that vasoconstriction follows vasodilation when the astrocytic calcium concentration (or perivascular potassium concentration) is increased further. We suggest that the interaction of the changing smooth muscle cell membrane potential and the changing potassium-dependent resting potential of the KIR channel are responsible for this effect. Finally, we demonstrate that a well-controlled mechanism of potassium buffering is potentially important for successful neurovascular coupling.},

@article{Yin2006,
abstract = {It has been postulated that the development of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may result from an imbalance between the generation and clearance of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). Although familial AD appears to be caused by Abeta overproduction, sporadic AD (the most prevalent form) may result from impairment in clearance. Recent evidence suggests that several proteases may contribute to the degradation of Abeta. Furthermore, astrocytes have recently been implicated as a potential cellular mediator of Abeta degradation. In this study, we examined the possibility that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), proteases known to be expressed and secreted by astrocytes, could play a role in extracellular Abeta degradation. We found that astrocytes surrounding amyloid plaques showed enhanced expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in aged amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 mice. Moreover, astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) degraded Abeta, lowering levels and producing several fragments after incubation with synthetic human Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42). This activity was attenuated with specific inhibitors of MMP-2 and -9, as well as in ACM derived from mmp-2 or -9 knock-out (KO) mice. In vivo, significant increases in the steady-state levels of Abeta were found in the brains of mmp-2 and -9 KO mice compared with wild-type controls. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the MMPs with N-[(2R)-2-(hydroxamidocarbonylmethyl)-4-methylpentanoyl]-L-tryptophan methylamide (GM 6001) increased brain interstitial fluid Abeta levels and elimination of half-life in APPsw mice. These results suggest that MMP-2 and -9 may contribute to extracellular brain Abeta clearance by promoting Abeta catabolism.},

abstract = {Vascular dysfunction has a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent data from brain imaging studies in humans and animal models suggest that cerebrovascular dysfunction may precede cognitive decline and onset of neurodegenerative changes in AD and AD models. Cerebral hypoperfusion and impaired amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) clearance across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may contribute to the onset and progression of dementia AD type. Decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) negatively affects the synthesis of proteins required for memory and learning, and may eventually lead to neuritic injury and neuronal death. Impaired clearance of Abeta from the brain by the cells of the neurovascular unit may lead to its accumulation on blood vessels and in brain parenchyma. The accumulation of Abeta on the cerebral blood vessels, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is associated with cognitive decline and is one of the hallmarks of AD pathology. CAA can severely disrupt the integrity of the blood vessel wall resulting in micro or macro intracerebral bleedings that exacerbates neurodegenerative process and inflammatory response and may lead to hemorrhagic stroke, respectively. Here, we review the role of the neurovascular unit and molecular mechanisms in vascular cells behind AD and CAA pathogenesis. First, we discuss apparent vascular changes, including the cerebral hypoperfusion and vascular degeneration that contribute to different stages of the disease process in AD individuals. We next discuss the role of the low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP), a key Abeta clearance receptor at the BBB and along the cerebrovascular system, whose expression is suppressed early in AD. We also discuss how brain-derived apolipoprotein E isoforms may influence Abeta clearance across the BBB. We then review the role of two interacting transcription factors, myocardin and serum response factor, in cerebral vascular cells in controlling CBF responses and LRP-mediated Abeta clearance. Finally, we discuss the role of microglia and perivascular macrophages in Abeta clearance from the brain. The data reviewed here support an essential role of neurovascular and BBB mechanisms in contributing to both, onset and progression of AD.},

abstract = {The question of the preferred substrate of glutamatergic neurons at high neural activity has been vibrantly debated for over a decade since the classical hypothesis (CH) of the primacy of glucose has been challenged by the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis (ANLSH), which replaces the primacy of glucose with astrocyte produced lactate. We perform Bayesian Flux Balance Analysis (BFBA) with a new mathematical model of cellular brain energetics, comprising detailed biochemical pathways in and between astrocytes and glutamatergic neurons and partitioning of each cell type into cytosol and mitochondria. Supported by the results of our in silico studies, which are in remarkable agreement with previously published results, we posit the Glucose Shunt Hypothesis (GSH) that during high activity, the inhibition of the phosphofructokinase (PFK) enzyme in neuron impairs neuronal glycolysis, enabling the process by which lactate effluxed by astrocytes is taken up by glutamatergic neurons, whereas at low activity, glucose remains the preferred substrate for neurons. We postulate that the ANLS is a shunt utilized by glutamatergic neurons to bypass their glycolysis impaired by the inhibition of PFK in connection with increased oxidative phosphorylation at high neuronal activity.},

abstract = {Intracranial pressure (ICP) is affected in many neurological conditions. Clinical measurement of pressure on the brain currently requires placing a probe in the cerebrospinal fluid compartment, the brain tissue, or other intracranial space. This invasiveness limits the measurement to critically ill patients. Because ICP is also clinically important in conditions ranging from brain tumors and hydrocephalus to concussions, noninvasive determination of ICP would be desirable. Our model-based approach to continuous estimation and tracking of ICP uses routinely obtainable time-synchronized, noninvasive (or minimally invasive) measurements of peripheral arterial blood pressure and blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCA), both at intra-heartbeat resolution. A physiological model of cerebrovascular dynamics provides mathematical constraints that relate the measured waveforms to ICP. Our algorithm produces patient-specific ICP estimates with no calibration or training. Using 35 hours of data from 37 patients with traumatic brain injury, we generated ICP estimates on 2665 nonoverlapping 60-beat data windows. Referenced against concurrently recorded invasive parenchymal ICP that varied over 100 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) across all records, our estimates achieved a mean error (bias) of 1.6 mmHg and SD of error (SDE) of 7.6 mmHg. For the 1673 data windows over 22 hours in which blood flow velocity recordings were available from both the left and the right MCA, averaging the resulting bilateral ICP estimates reduced the bias to 1.5 mmHg and SDE to 5.9 mmHg. This accuracy is already comparable to that of some invasive ICP measurement methods in current clinical use.},

abstract = {Fast excitatory synapses are generally thought to act as private communication channels between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. Some recent findings, however, suggest that glutamate may diffuse out of the synaptic cleft and bind to several subtypes of receptors, either in the perisynaptic membrane or at neighboring synapses. it is not known whether activation of these receptors can occur in response to the release of a single vesicle of glutamate. Here we estimate the spatiotemporal profile of glutamate in the extrasynaptic space after vesicle exocytosis, guided by detailed ultrastructural measurements of the CA1 neuropil in the adult rat. We argue that the vicinity of the synapse can be treated as an isotropic porous medium, in which diffusion is determined by the extracellular volume fraction and the tortuosity factor, and develop novel stereological methods to estimate these parameters. We also estimate the spatial separation between synapses, to ask whether glutamate released at one synapse can activate NMDA and other high-affinity receptors at a neighboring synapse. Kinetic simulations of extrasynaptic glutamate uptake show that transporters rapidly reduce the free concentration of transmitter. Exocytosis of a single vesicle is, however, sufficient to bind to high-affinity receptors situated in the immediate perisynaptic space. The distance separating a typical synapse from its nearest neighbor is similar to 465 nm. Whether glutamate can reach a sufficient concentration to activate NMDA receptors at this distance depends critically on the diffusion coefficient in the extracellular space. If diffusion is much slower than in free aqueous solution, NMDA receptors could mediate crosstalk between neighboring synapses.},

While much is known about molecular mechanisms underlying cerebral A$\beta$ accumulation in familial AD, less is known about the cause(s) of brain amyloidosis in sporadic disease. Animal and postmortem studies suggest that A$\beta$ secretion can be up-regulated in response to hypoxia. We employed a new technology (Single Molecule Arrays, SiMoA) capable of ultrasensitive protein measurements and developed a novel assay to look for changes in serum A$\beta$42 concentration in 25 resuscitated patients with severe hypoxia due to cardiac arrest. After a lag period of 10 or more hours, very clear serum A$\beta$42 elevations were observed in all patients. Elevations ranged from approximately 80\% to over 70-fold, with most elevations in the range of 3-10-fold (average approximately 7-fold). The magnitude of the increase correlated with clinical outcome. These data provide the first direct evidence in living humans that ischemia acutely increases A$\beta$ levels in blood. The results point to the possibility that hypoxia may play a role in the amyloidogenic process of AD.},

It is believed that the environmental risk factors play an important role in the onset and development of AD. Patients suffering from cerebral ischemia and stroke in which hypoxic conditions occur are much more susceptible to AD. Increasing evidence suggests that hypoxia facilitates the pathogenesis of AD through accelerating the accumulation of Abeta, increasing the hyperphosphorylation of tau, impairing the normal functions of blood-brain barrier, and promoting the degeneration of neurons. Further investigations into the relationship between hypoxia and AD may open the avenue for effective preservation and pharmacological treatments of this neurodegenerative disease.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. In connection with the global trend of prolonging human life and the increasing number of elderly in the population, the AD becomes one of the most serious health and socioeconomic problems of the present. Tau protein promotes assembly and stabilizes microtubules, which contributes to the proper function of neuron. Alterations in the amount or the structure of tau protein can affect its role as a stabilizer of microtubules as well as some of the processes in which it is implicated. The molecular mechanisms governing tau aggregation are mainly represented by several posttranslational modifications that alter its structure and conformational state. Hence, abnormal phosphorylation and truncation of tau protein have gained attention as key mechanisms that become tau protein in a pathological entity. Evidences about the clinicopathological significance of phosphorylated and truncated tau have been documented during the progression of AD as well as their capacity to exert cytotoxicity when expressed in cell and animal models. This paper describes the normal structure and function of tau protein and its major alterations during its pathological aggregation in AD.},

abstract = {In contrast to traditional neuroncentric views of Alzheimer's disease (AD), recent findings indicate that neurovascular dysfunction contributes to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in AD. Here, I propose the neurovascular hypothesis of AD, suggesting that faulty clearance of amyloid beta peptide (A beta) across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), aberrant angiogenesis and senescence of the cerebrovascular system could initiate neurovascular uncoupling, vessel regression, brain hypoperfusion and neurovascular inflammation. Ultimately, this would lead to BBB compromise, to chemical imbalance in the neuronal environment and to synaptic and neuronal dysfunction, injury and loss. Based on the neurovascular hypothesis, I suggest an array of new potential therapeutic approaches that could be developed for AD, to enhance A beta clearance and neurovascular repair, and to protect the neurovascular unit from divergent inducers of injury and apoptosis.},

abstract = {An important issue in synaptic physiology is the extent to which postsynaptic receptors are saturated by the neurotransmitter released from a single synaptic vesicle. Although the bulk of evidence supports receptor saturation, recent studies have started to reveal that alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors may not be saturated by a single vesicle of glutamate. Here, we address this question through a study of putative single synapses, made by hippocampal neurons in culture, that are identified by FM1-43 staining. An analysis of the sources of variability in the amplitudes of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents at single synapses reveals that this variability must arise presynaptically, from variations in the quantity of agonist released. Thus, glutamate receptors at hippocampal synapses are not generally saturated by quantal release.},

The challenge is to unravel the link. Here we show, using spectrophotometry to record oxyhaemoglobin and methemoglobin (surrogate markers of cerebral flow and nitric oxide levels respectively) together with extracellular neuronal recordings in vivo and applying a multiple polynomial regression model, that the markers are able to predict up about 80\% of variability in NR. Furthermore, we show that the coupling between blood flow and neuronal activity is heavily influenced by nitric oxide (NO). While NRs show the typical saturating response, blood flow shows a linear behaviour during contrast-response curves, with nitric oxide from different sources acting differently for low and high intensity.},

@article{Ostby2009,
abstract = {Neuronal stimulation causes approximately 30\% shrinkage of the extracellular space (ECS) between neurons and surrounding astrocytes in grey and white matter under experimental conditions. Despite its possible implications for a proper understanding of basic aspects of potassium clearance and astrocyte function, the phenomenon remains unexplained. Here we present a dynamic model that accounts for current experimental data related to the shrinkage phenomenon in wild-type as well as in gene knockout individuals. We find that neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride in passive channels, action of the Na/K/ATPase pump, and osmotically driven transport of water through the astrocyte membrane together seem sufficient for generating ECS shrinkage as such. However, when taking into account ECS and astrocyte ion concentrations observed in connection with neuronal stimulation, the actions of the Na(+)/K(+)/Cl(-) (NKCC1) and the Na(+)/HCO(3) (-) (NBC) cotransporters appear to be critical determinants for achieving observed quantitative levels of ECS shrinkage. Considering the current state of knowledge, the model framework appears sufficiently detailed and constrained to guide future key experiments and pave the way for more comprehensive astroglia-neuron interaction models for normal as well as pathophysiological situations.},

@article{Hamel2006,
abstract = {Brain perfusion is tightly coupled to neuronal activity, is commonly used to monitor normal or pathological brain function, and is a direct reflection of the interactions that occur between neuronal signals and blood vessels. Cerebral blood vessels at the surface and within the brain are surrounded by nerve fibers that originate, respectively, from peripheral nerve ganglia and intrinsic brain neurons. Although of different origin and targeting distinct vascular beds, these "perivascular nerves" fulfill similar roles related to cerebrovascular functions, a major one being to regulate their tone and, therein, brain perfusion. This utmost function, which underlies the signals used in functional neuroimaging techniques and which can be jeopardized in pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and migraine headache, is thus regulated at several levels. Recently, new insights into our understanding of how neural input regulate cerebrovascular tone resulted in the rediscovery of the functional "neurovascular unit." These remarkable advances suggest that neuron-driven changes in vascular tone result from interactions that involve all components of the neurovascular unit, transducing neuronal signals into vasomotor responses not only through direct interaction between neurons and vessels but also indirectly via the perivascular astrocytes. Neurovascular coupling is thus determined by chemical signals released from activated perivascular nerves and astrocytes that alter vascular tone to locally adjust perfusion to the spatial and temporal changes in brain activity.},

abstract = {Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is dually acylated by N-myristoylation and cysteine palmitoylation and resides in Golgi and caveolae membranes. N-Myristoylation is necessary for its membrane association and targeting into the Golgi complex of transfected cells whereas palmitoylation influences the targeting of eNOS into caveolae. However, the in vivo significance of palmitoylation, membrane association, and the corresponding caveolar localization of eNOS have not been shown. To further examine the nature of membrane association of palmitoylation-deficient forms of eNOS and to address the functional role(s) of palmitoylation in activation of eNOS in vivo, HEk 293 cells stably transfected with wild-type (WT) or palmitoylation-deficient mutants of eNOS were generated. Membrane association of the mutants was biochemically similar to that of the WT protein in terms of their resistance to high salt, high pH, and distribution between Triton X-114 detergent and aqueous phases, suggesting that other hydrophobic factor (s) in eNOS most likely contribute to its membrane association. Most importantly, palmitoylation-deficient mutants of eNOS released less NO from the cells than did WT enzyme, suggesting that palmitoylation plays an important role in determining the optimal release of NO from intact cells. The diminished release of NO from the palmitoylation-deficient mutants was not attributable to alterations in its catalytic properties as the purified mutant and WT enzymes were kinetically identical. Since palmitoylation is necessary for localization of eNOS in caveolae, our data suggest that such localization could regulate the frequency and magnitude of NO release in response to stimuli in vivo.},

abstract = {In spite of intense recent investigation of the physiological and pathophysiological roles of endogenously produced nitric oxide (.NO) in mammalian systems, little quantitative information exists concerning the diffusion of this small nonelectrolyte from its source (NO synthase) to its targets of action. I present here a conceptual framework for analyzing the intracellular and intercellular diffusion and reaction of free .NO, using kinetic modeling and calculations of the diffusibility of .NO and its reactions in aqueous solution based on published data. If the half-life of .NO is greater than approximately 25 msec and the rates of reaction of .NO with its targets are slower than its diffusion or reaction with O2 (for which there is experimental evidence in at least some systems), then (i) .NO acts in vivo in a mostly paracrine fashion for a collection of .NO-producing cells, (ii) .NO diffuses to significant concentrations at distances relatively far removed from a single .NO-producing cell, and (iii) localized sites of vascularization will scavenge .NO (and thus decrease its actions) at distances many cell diameters away from that site. These conclusions have important implications with regard to the mechanism of endothelium-dependent relaxation, the autocrine vs. paracrine actions of .NO, and the role of the spatial relationship between specific sites of .NO formation and neighboring blood vessels in .NO-effected and -affected neuronal signal transmission.},

abstract = {A cell culture model of blood-brain barrier (BBB, coculture of rat brain endothelial cells with rat astrocytes) was used to investigate the effect of nitric oxide (.NO) on the damage of the BBB induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). Permeability coefficient of fluorescein across the endothelium was used as a marker of BBB tightness. The permeability coefficient increased 5.2 times after H/R indicating strong disruption of the BBB. The presence of the .NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP, 30 microM), authentic .NO (6 microM) or superoxide dismutase (50 units/ml) during H/R attenuated H/R-induced increase in permeability. 30 microM SNAP or 6 microM .NO did not influence the function of BBB during normoxia, however, severe disruption was observed using 150 microM of SNAP and more than 24 microM of .NO. After H/R of endothelial cells, the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) increased 2.3 times indicating radical-induced peroxidation of membrane lipids. 30 microM SNAP or 6 microM authentic .NO completely prevented MDA formation. The results show that .NO may effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species formed during H/R of brain capillary endothelial cells, affording protection of BBB at the molecular and functional level.},

abstract = {Low nanomolar concentrations of nitric oxide activate guanylyl cyclase to produce cGMP, which has diverse physiological effects. Higher concentrations inhibit mitochondrial respiration at cytochrome c oxidase and this has been proposed to be important physiologically, increasing oxygen permeation into tissue (by reducing the oxygen use of cells near blood vessels), activating AMP kinase, and regulating the relationship between cerebral blood flow and oxygen use. It is unclear, however, whether nitric oxide can accumulate physiologically to concentrations at which inhibition of respiration occurs. In rat cerebellar slices, we activated nitric oxide production from each isoform of nitric oxide synthase. Only activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase, which is expressed pathologically, caused any significant inhibition of respiration. Modelling oxygen and nitric oxide concentrations predicted that, in vivo, physiological nitric oxide levels are too low to affect respiration. Even pathologically, the nitric oxide concentration may only rise to 2.5 nm, producing a 1.5\% inhibition of respiration. Thus, under physiological conditions, nitric oxide signals do not inhibit respiration but are well-tuned to the dynamic range of guanylyl cyclase activation.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO), which accounts for the biological activity of endothelium-derived relaxing factor, is now thought to play a variety of roles in the nervous system and in immunologic reactions. NO is synthesized from L-arginine by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). There are three isoforms of NOS; type I (neuronal), type II (inducible), and type III (endothelial). The fundamental structure of the three isoforms, which contain calmodulin-, FMN-, FAD-, and NADPH-binding domains, is the same. Calmodulin is already bound to inducible NOS without requiring Ca2+, while the others are Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent. Endothelial NOS is bound to membranes by N-myristoylation, while the other isoforms are soluble. The human endothelial NOS gene has been cloned. It has several highly repetitive regions which could provide potential sites for DNA polymorphism. It might be of interest to examine the relationship between such polymorphism and cardiovascular disorders.},

Brain tissue volumes were quantified from MRI. Functional status was assessed by gait speed, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), modified Rankin Scale, and NIH Stroke Score.Compared to the non-stroke group, stroke subjects showed degraded dCA bilaterally, and showed gray matter atrophy in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes ipsilateral to infarct. In stroke subjects, better dCA was associated with less temporal lobe gray matter atrophy on the infracted side ([Formula: see text] = 0.029), faster gait speed ([Formula: see text] = 0.018) and lower IADL score ([Formula: see text]0.002). Our results indicate that better dynamic cerebral perfusion regulation is associated with less atrophy and better long-term functional status in older adults with chronic ischemic infarctions.},

abstract = {Periods of chronic hypoxia, which can arise from numerous cardiorespiratory disorders, predispose individuals to the development of dementias, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is characterized in part by the increased production of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), which forms the extracellular plaques by which the disease can be identified post mortem. Numerous studies have now shown that hypoxia, even in vitro, can increase production of Abeta in different cell types. Evidence has been produced to indicate hypoxia alters both expression of the Abeta precursor, APP, and also the expression of the secretase enzymes, which cleave Abeta from APP. Other studies implicate reduced Abeta degradation as a possible means by which hypoxia increases Abeta levels. Such variability may be attributable to cell-specific responses to hypoxia. Further evidence indicates that some, but not all of the cellular adaptations to chronic hypoxia (including alteration of Ca(2+) homeostasis) require Abeta formation. However, other aspects of hypoxic remodeling of cell function appear to occur independently of this process. The molecular and cellular responses to hypoxia contribute to our understanding of the clinical association of hypoxia and increased incidence of AD. However, it remains to be determined whether inhibition of one or more of the effects of hypoxia may be of benefit in arresting the development of this neurodegenerative disease.},

abstract = {Astroglia from the postnatal cerebral cortex can be reprogrammed in vitro to generate neurons following forced expression of neurogenic transcription factors, thus opening new avenues towards a potential use of endogenous astroglia for brain repair. However, in previous attempts astroglia-derived neurons failed to establish functional synapses, a severe limitation towards functional neurogenesis. It remained therefore also unknown whether neurons derived from reprogrammed astroglia could be directed towards distinct neuronal subtype identities by selective expression of distinct neurogenic fate determinants. Here we show that strong and persistent expression of neurogenic fate determinants driven by silencing-resistant retroviral vectors instructs astroglia from the postnatal cortex in vitro to mature into fully functional, synapse-forming neurons. Importantly, the neurotransmitter fate choice of astroglia-derived neurons can be controlled by selective expression of distinct neurogenic transcription factors: forced expression of the dorsal telencephalic fate determinant neurogenin-2 (Neurog2) directs cortical astroglia to generate synapse-forming glutamatergic neurons; in contrast, the ventral telencephalic fate determinant Dlx2 induces a GABAergic identity, although the overall efficiency of Dlx2-mediated neuronal reprogramming is much lower compared to Neurog2, suggesting that cortical astroglia possess a higher competence to respond to the dorsal telencephalic fate determinant. Interestingly, however, reprogramming of astroglia towards the generation of GABAergic neurons was greatly facilitated when the astroglial cells were first expanded as neurosphere cells prior to transduction with Dlx2. Importantly, this approach of expansion under neurosphere conditions and subsequent reprogramming with distinct neurogenic transcription factors can also be extended to reactive astroglia isolated from the adult injured cerebral cortex, allowing for the selective generation of glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. These data provide evidence that cortical astroglia can undergo a conversion across cell lineages by forced expression of a single neurogenic transcription factor, stably generating fully differentiated neurons. Moreover, neuronal reprogramming of astroglia is not restricted to postnatal stages but can also be achieved from terminally differentiated astroglia of the adult cerebral cortex following injury-induced reactivation.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanism of brain glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier is of importance to understanding brain energy metabolism. The specific kinetics of glucose transport have been generally described using standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics. These models predict that the steady-state glucose concentration approaches an upper limit in the human brain when the plasma glucose level is well above the Michaelis-Menten constant for half-maximal transport, Kt. In experiments where steady-state plasma glucose content was varied from 4 to 30 mM, the brain glucose level was a linear function of plasma glucose concentration. At plasma concentrations nearing 30 mM, the brain glucose level approached 9 mM, which was significantly higher than predicted from the previously reported Kt of approximately 4 mM (p < 0.05). The high brain glucose concentration measured in the human brain suggests that ablumenal brain glucose may compete with lumenal glucose for transport. We developed a model based on a reversible Michaelis-Menten kinetic formulation of unidirectional transport rates. Fitting this model to brain glucose level as a function of plasma glucose level gave a substantially lower Kt of 0.6 +/- 2.0 mM, which was consistent with the previously reported millimolar Km of GLUT-1 in erythrocyte model systems. Previously reported and reanalyzed quantification provided consistent kinetic parameters. We conclude that cerebral glucose transport is most consistently described when using reversible Michaelis-Menten kinetics.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in a large number of cellular processes and dysfunctions in NO production have been implicated in many different disease states. In the vasculature NO is released by endothelial cells where it modulates the underlying smooth muscle to regulate vascular tone. Due to the unique chemistry of NO, such as its reactive and free radical nature, it can interact with many different cellular constituents such as thiols and transition metal ions, which determine its cellular actions. In this review we also discuss many of the useful pharmacological tools that have been developed and used extensively to establish the involvement of NO in endothelium-derived relaxations. In addition, the recent literature identifying a potential source of NO in endothelial cells, which is not directly derived from endothelial nitric oxide synthase is examined. Finally, the photorelaxation phenomena, which mediates the release of NO from a vascular smooth muscle NO store, is discussed.},

abstract = {Fluid shear stress activates the endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) by a mechanism which does not require an increase in the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), and is sensitive to several kinase inhibitors. Although phosphorylation of eNOS has been suggested to regulate enzyme activity, the mechanism of eNOS activation is still unclear. Here we demonstrate that fluid shear stress elicits the phosphorylation of eNOS on tyrosine and serine residues. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), using wortmannin or a dominant negative mutant of its downstream target, Akt (protein kinase B), prevented the maintained serine phosphorylation and activation of eNOS. Enhancing eNOS phosphorylation by inhibiting serine/threonine phosphatases, increased eNOS activity by approximately twofold, as assessed by the accumulation of intracellular cyclic GMP, without increasing the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+. These data suggest that shear stress activates a pathway involving PI3K and the serine/threonine kinase Akt, which phosphorylates eNOS. This phosphorylation directly increases eNOS activity at resting [Ca2+]i, thus rendering the shear stress-induced activation of eNOS apparently Ca2+-independent.},

abstract = {Amyloid beta (A$\beta$) has been proposed to play a central and causative role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. A$\beta$(25-35), the neurotoxic domain of the full-length A$\beta$, causes learning and memory impairments in rodents. The present study investigated the effects of a single bilateral i.c.v. infusion of pre-aggregated A$\beta$(25-35) (30 nmol/rat) on animals' performance in the open field, and on arginine metabolic enzymes and metabolites in the CA1, CA2/3, and dentate gyrus (DG) sub-regions of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) at the time point of 6-8 days after A$\beta$ infusion. A$\beta$(25-35) rats displayed reduced exploratory activity in the open field relative to the A$\beta$(35-25) (reverse peptide; 30 nmol) rats. A$\beta$(25-35) resulted in significantly decreased nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and endothelial NOS protein expression, but increased arginase activity, arginase II protein expression, and ornithine and putrescine levels, in hippocampal CA2/3. There were increased glutamate and putrescine levels in the DG, but decreased agmatine levels in the DG and PFC, in the A$\beta$(25-35) group relative to the A$\beta$(35-25) one. Cluster analyses were performed to determine if the nine related neurochemical variables (arginine, citrulline, ornithine, agmatine, putrescine, spermidine, spemine, glutamate, and GABA) formed distinct groups, and whether it changed as a function of A$\beta$(25-35). There were substantially different clusters between the two groups in the hippocampus and PFC. These results demonstrate that A$\beta$(25-35) alters arginine metabolism, which further supports the prominent role of arginine and its metabolites in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis.},

It is designed to introduce cell biology and neuroscience students to computational modeling, and applied mathematics students, theoretical biologists, and engineers to many of the problems in dynamical cell biology. This volume was conceived of and begun by Professor Joel Keizer based on his many years of teaching and research together with his colleagues. The project was expanded and finished by his students and friends after his untimely death in 1999. Carefully selected examples are used to motivate the concepts and techniques of computational cell biology, through a progression of increasingly more complex and demanding cases. Illustrative exercises are included with every chapter, and mathematical and computational appendices are provided for reference. This textbook will be useful for advanced undergraduate and graduate theoretical biologists, and for mathematics students and life scientists who wish to learn about modeling in cell biology.

abstract = {Recent epidemiological studies suggest that diabetes mellitus is a strong risk factor for Alzheimer disease. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, to investigate the pathophysiological interaction between these diseases, we generated animal models that reflect the pathologic conditions of both diseases. We crossed Alzheimer transgenic mice (APP23) with two types of diabetic mice (ob/ob and NSY mice), and analyzed their metabolic and brain pathology. The onset of diabetes exacerbated Alzheimer-like cognitive dysfunction without an increase in brain amyloid-beta burden in double-mutant (APP(+)-ob/ob) mice. Notably, APP(+)-ob/ob mice showed cerebrovascular inflammation and severe amyloid angiopathy. Conversely, the cross-bred mice showed an accelerated diabetic phenotype compared with ob/ob mice, suggesting that Alzheimer amyloid pathology could aggravate diabetes. Similarly, APP(+)-NSY fusion mice showed more severe glucose intolerance compared with diabetic NSY mice. Furthermore, high-fat diet feeding induced severe memory deficits in APP(+)-NSY mice without an increase in brain amyloid-beta load. Here, we created Alzheimer mouse models with early onset of cognitive dysfunction. Cerebrovascular changes and alteration in brain insulin signaling might play a pivotal role in this relationship. These findings could provide insights into this intensely debated association.},

Furthermore, new data are presented that provide novel insights into how disruption of the eNOS dimer prevents eNOS uncoupling and the production of superoxide under conditions of elevated oxidative stress and identifies a novel regulatory region we have termed the 'flexible arm'.},

abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is formed by brain endothelial cells lining the cerebral microvasculature, and is an important mechanism for protecting the brain from fluctuations in plasma composition, and from circulating agents such as neurotransmitters and xenobiotics capable of disturbing neural function. The barrier also plays an important role in the homeostatic regulation of the brain microenvironment necessary for the stable and co-ordinated activity of neurones. The BBB phenotype develops under the influence of associated brain cells, especially astrocytic glia, and consists of more complex tight junctions than in other capillary endothelia, and a number of specific transport and enzyme systems which regulate molecular traffic across the endothelial cells. Transporters characteristic of the BBB phenotype include both uptake mechanisms (e.g. GLUT-1 glucose carrier, L1 amino acid transporter) and efflux transporters (e.g. P-glycoprotein). In addition to a role in long-term barrier induction and maintenance, astrocytes and other cells can release chemical factors that modulate endothelial permeability over a time-scale of seconds to minutes. Cell culture models, both primary and cell lines, have been used to investigate aspects of barrier induction and modulation. Conditioned medium taken from growing glial cells can reproduce some of the inductive effects, evidence for involvement of diffusible factors. However, for some features of endothelial differentiation and induction, the extracellular matrix plays an important role. Several candidate molecules have been identified, capable of mimicking aspects of glial-mediated barrier induction of brain endothelium; these include TGFbeta, GDNF, bFGF, IL-6 and steroids. In addition, factors secreted by brain endothelial cells including leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) have been shown to induce astrocytic differentiation. Thus endothelium and astrocytes are involved in two-way induction. Short-term modulation of brain endothelial permeability has been shown for a number of small chemical mediators produced by astrocytes and other nearby cell types. It is clear that endothelial cells are involved in both long- and short-term chemical communication with neighbouring cells, with the perivascular end feet of astrocytes being of particular importance. The role of barrier induction and modulation in normal physiology and in pathology is discussed.},

abstract = {Background Experimental evidence suggests that flow-dependent dilatation of conduit arteries is mediated by nitric oxide (NO) and/or prostacyclin. The present study was designed to assess whether NO or prostacyclin also contributes to flow-dependent dilatation of conduit arteries in humans.  Methods and Results Radial artery internal diameter (ID) was measured continuously in 16 healthy volunteers (age, 24\{+/-\}1 years) with a transcutaneous A-mode echo-tracking system coupled to a Doppler device for the measurement of radial blood flow. In 8 subjects, a catheter was inserted into the brachial artery for measurement of arterial pressure and infusion of the NO synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA; 8 \{micro\}mol/min for 7 minutes; infusion rate, 0.8 mL/min). Flow-dependent dilatation was evaluated before and after L-NMMA or aspirin as the response of the radial artery to an acute increase in flow (reactive hyperemia after a 3-minute cuff wrist occlusion). Under control conditions, release of the occlusion induced a marked increase in radial blood flow (from 24\{+/-\}3 to 73\{+/-\}11 mL/min; P<.01) followed by a delayed increase in radial diameter (flow-mediated dilatation; from 2.67\{+/-\}0.10 to 2.77\{+/-\}0.12 mm; P<.01) without any change in heart rate or arterial pressure. L-NMMA decreased basal forearm blood flow (from 24\{+/-\}3 to 13\{+/-\}3 mL/min; P<.05) without affecting basal radial artery diameter, heart rate, or arterial pressure, whereas aspirin (1 g PO) was without any hemodynamic effect. In the presence of L-NMMA, the peak flow response during hyperemia was not affected (76\{+/-\}12 mL/min), but the duration of the hyperemic response was markedly reduced, and the flow-dependent dilatation of the radial artery was abolished and converted to a vasoconstriction (from 2.62\{+/-\}0.11 to 2.55\{+/-\}0.11 mm; P<.01). In contrast, aspirin did not affect the hyperemic response nor the flow-dependent dilatation of the radial artery.  Conclusions The present investigation demonstrates that NO, but not prostacyclin, is essential for flow-mediated dilatation of large human arteries. Hence, this response can be used as a test for the L-arginine/NO pathway in clinical studies.},

abstract = {Amyloid-$\beta$ interacts with two cell surface receptors, CD36 and CD47, through which the matricellular protein thrombospondin-1 inhibits soluble guanylate cyclase activation. Here we examine whether amyloid-$\beta$ shares this inhibitory activity. Amyloid-$\beta$ inhibited both drug and nitric oxide-mediated activation of soluble guanylate cyclase in several cell types. Known cGMP-dependent functional responses to nitric oxide in platelets and vascular smooth muscle cells were correspondingly inhibited by amyloid-$\beta$. Functional interaction of amyloid-$\beta$ with the scavenger receptor CD36 was indicated by inhibition of free fatty acid uptake via this receptor. Both soluble oligomer and fibrillar forms of amyloid-$\beta$ were active. In contrast, amyloid-$\beta$ did not compete with the known ligand SIRP$\alpha$ for binding to CD47. However, both receptors were necessary for amyloid-$\beta$ to inhibit cGMP accumulation. These data suggest that amyloid-$\beta$ interaction with CD36 induces a CD47-dependent signal that inhibits soluble guanylate cyclase activation. Combined with the pleiotropic effects of inhibiting free fatty acid transport via CD36, these data provides a molecular mechanism through which amyloid-$\beta$ can contribute to the nitric oxide signaling deficiencies associated with Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with a cascade of pathological events involving formation of amyloid-based neuritic plaques and tau-based neurofibrillary tangles, changes in brain structure and function, and eventually, cognitive impairment and functional disability. The precise sequence of when each of these disease markers becomes abnormal is not yet clearly understood. The present study systematically tested the relationship between classes of biomarkers according to a proposed model of temporal sequence by Jack et al. (Lancet Neurology 9:119-128, 2010). We examined temporal relations among four classes of biomarkers: CSF A$\beta$, CSF tau, neuroimaging variables (hippocampal volume, ventricular volume, FDG PET), and cognitive variables (memory and executive function). Random effects modeling of longitudinal data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was used to test hypotheses that putative earlier markers of AD predicted change in later markers, and that intervening markers reduced effects of earlier on later markers. Specifically, we hypothesized that CSF tau would explain CSF A$\beta$'s relation to neuroimaging and cognitive variables, and neuroimaging variables would explain tau's relation to cognitive variables. Consistent with hypotheses, results indicated that CSF A$\beta$ effects on cognition change were substantially attenuated by CSF tau and measures of brain structure and function, and CSF tau effects on cognitive change were attenuated by neuroimaging variables. Contrary to hypotheses, CSF A$\beta$ and CSF tau were observed to have independent effects on neuroimaging and CSF tau had a direct effect on baseline cognition independent of brain structure and function. These results have implications for clarifying the temporal sequence of AD changes and corresponding biomarkers.},

abstract = {Endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is the predominant enzyme responsible for vascular NO synthesis. A functional eNOS transfers electrons from NADPH to its heme center, where L-arginine is oxidized to L-citrulline and NO. Common conditions predisposing to atherosclerosis, such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus and smoking, are associated with enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduced amounts of bioactive NO in the vessel wall. NADPH oxidases represent major sources of ROS in cardiovascular pathophysiology. NADPH oxidase-derived superoxide avidly interacts with eNOS-derived NO to form peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)), which oxidizes the essential NOS cofactor (6R-)5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)). As a consequence, oxygen reduction uncouples from NO synthesis, thereby rendering NOS to a superoxide-producing pro-atherosclerotic enzyme. Supplementation with BH(4) corrects eNOS dysfunction in several animal models and in patients. Administration of high local doses of the antioxidant L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) improves endothelial function, whereas large-scale clinical trials do not support a strong role for oral vitamin C and/or E in reducing cardiovascular disease. Statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1 receptor blockers have the potential of reducing vascular oxidative stress. Finally, novel approaches are being tested to block pathways leading to oxidative stress (e.g. protein kinase C) or to upregulate antioxidant enzymes.},

abstract = {Cerebral autoregulation (CA) is an most important mechanism responsible for the relatively constant blood flow supply to brain when cerebral perfusion pressure varies. Its assessment in nonacute cases has been relied on the quantification of the relationship between noninvasive beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) and blood flow velocity (BFV). To overcome the nonstationary nature of physiological signals such as BP and BFV, a computational method called multimodal pressure-flow (MMPF) analysis was recently developed to study the nonlinear BP-BFV relationship during the Valsalva maneuver (VM). The present study aimed to determine (i) whether this method can estimate autoregulation from spontaneous BP and BFV fluctuations during baseline rest conditions; (ii) whether there is any difference between the MMPF measures of autoregulation based on intra-arterial BP (ABP) and based on cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP); and (iii) whether the MMPF method provides reproducible and reliable measure for noninvasive assessment of autoregulation. To achieve these aims, we analyzed data from existing databases including: (i) ABP and BFV of 12 healthy control, 10 hypertensive, and 10 stroke subjects during baseline resting conditions and during the Valsalva maneuver, and (ii) ABP, CPP, and BFV of 30 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who were being paralyzed, sedated, and ventilated. We showed that autoregulation in healthy control subjects can be characterized by specific phase shifts between BP and BFV oscillations during the Valsalva maneuver, and the BP-BFV phase shifts were reduced in hypertensive and stroke subjects (P < 0.01), indicating impaired autoregulation. Similar results were found during baseline condition from spontaneous BP and BFV oscillations. The BP-BFV phase shifts obtained during baseline and during VM were highly correlated (R > 0.8, P < 0.0001), showing no statistical difference (paired-t test P > 0.47). In TBI patients there were strong correlations between phases of ABP and CPP oscillations (R = 0.99, P < 0.0001) and, thus, between ABP-BFV and CPP-BFV phase shifts (P < 0.0001, R = 0.76). By repeating the MMPF 4 times on data of TBI subjects, each time on a selected cycle of spontaneous BP and BFV oscillations, we showed that MMPF had better reproducibility than traditional autoregulation index. These results indicate that the MMPF method, based on instantaneous phase relationships between cerebral blood flow velocity and peripheral blood pressure, has better performance than the traditional standard method, and can reliably assess cerebral autoregulation dynamics from ambulatory blood pressure and cerebral blood flow during supine rest conditions.},

abstract = {Endothelial cells release nitric oxide (NO) more potently in response to increased shear stress than to agonists which elevate intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). To determine mechanistic differences in the regulation of endothelial constitutive NO synthase (ecNOS), we measured NO production by bovine aortic endothelial cells exposed to shear stress in a laminar flow chamber or treated with Ca2+ ionophores in static culture. The kinetics of cumulative NO production varied strikingly: shear stress (25 dyne/cm2) stimulated a biphasic increase over control that was 13-fold at 60 minutes, whereas raising [Ca2+]i caused a monophasic 6-fold increase. We hypothesized that activation of a protein kinase cascade mediates the early phase of flow-dependent NO production. Immunoprecipitation of ecNOS showed a 210\% increase in phosphorylation 1 minute after flow initiation, whereas there was no significant increase after Ca2+ ionophore treatment. Although ecNOS was not tyrosine-phosphorylated, the early phase of flow-dependent NO production was blocked by genistein, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases. To determine the Ca2+ requirement for flow-dependent NO production, we measured [Ca2+]i with a novel flow-step protocol. [Ca2+]i increased with the onset of shear stress, but not after a step increase. However, the step increase in shear stress was associated with a potent biphasic increase in NO production rate and ecNOS phosphorylation. These studies demonstrate that shear stress can increase NO production in the absence of increased [Ca2+]i, and they suggest that phosphorylation of ecNOS may importantly modulate its activity during the imposition of increased shear stress.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in autocrine and paracrine manner in numerous physiological processes, including regulation of blood pressure and blood flow, platelet aggregation, and leukocyte adhesion. In vascular wall, most of the bioavailable NO is believed to derive from endothelial cell NO synthase (eNOS). Recently, neuronal NOS (nNOS) has been identified as a source of NO in the vicinity of microvessels and has been shown to participate in vascular function. Thus NO can be produced and transported to the vascular smooth muscle cells from 1). endothelial cells and 2). perivascular nerve fibers, mast cells, and other nNOS-containing sources. In this study, a mathematical model of NO diffusion-reaction in a cylindrical arteriolar segment was formulated. The model quantifies the relative contribution of these NO sources and the smooth muscle availability of NO in a tissue containing an arteriolar blood vessel. The results indicate that a source of NO derived through nNOS in the perivascular region can be a significant contributor to smooth muscle NO. Predicted smooth muscle NO concentrations are as high as 430 nM, which is consistent with reported experimental measurements approximately 400 nM). In addition, we used the model to analyze the smooth muscle NO availability in 1). eNOS and nNOS knockout experiments, 2). the presence of myoglobin, and 3). the presence of cell-free Hb, e.g., Hb-based oxygen carriers. The results show that NO release by nNOS would significantly affect available smooth muscle NO. Further experimental and theoretical studies are required to account for distribution of NOS isoforms and determine NO availability in vasculatures of different tissues.},

abstract = {The brain is critically dependent on a continuous supply of blood to function. Therefore, the cerebral vasculature is endowed with neurovascular control mechanisms that assure that the blood supply of the brain is commensurate to the energy needs of its cellular constituents. The regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) during brain activity involves the coordinated interaction of neurons, glia, and vascular cells. Thus, whereas neurons and glia generate the signals initiating the vasodilation, endothelial cells, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells act in concert to transduce these signals into carefully orchestrated vascular changes that lead to CBF increases focused to the activated area and temporally linked to the period of activation. Neurovascular coupling is disrupted in pathological conditions, such as hypertension, Alzheimer disease, and ischemic stroke. Consequently, CBF is no longer matched to the metabolic requirements of the tissue. This cerebrovascular dysregulation is mediated in large part by the deleterious action of reactive oxygen species on cerebral blood vessels. A major source of cerebral vascular radicals in models of hypertension and Alzheimer disease is the enzyme NADPH oxidase. These findings, collectively, highlight the importance of neurovascular coupling to the health of the normal brain and suggest a therapeutic target for improving brain function in pathologies associated with cerebrovascular dysfunction.},

We say that the parameter vector is feasible if there exists a positive solution to this system. A set of all feasible parameter vectors is called the feasibility set. If all the positive entries are log-convex functions, the paper shows that the associated Perron root is log-convex on the parameter set and the l1-norm of the solution is log-convex on the feasibility set. These results imply that the feasibility set is a convex set regardless whether the l1-norm of the solution is bounded by some positive real number or not. Finally, we show important applications of these results to wireless communication networks and prove some other interesting results for this special case.},

ICWs occur in a wide diversity of cells and have been extensively studied in vitro. More recent studies focus on ICWs in vivo. ICWs are triggered by a variety of stimuli and involve the release of Ca(2+) from internal stores. The propagation of ICWs predominately involves cell communication with internal messengers moving via gap junctions or extracellular messengers mediating paracrine signaling. ICWs appear to be important in both normal physiology as well as pathophysiological processes in a variety of organs and tissues including brain, liver, retina, cochlea, and vascular tissue. We review here the mechanisms of initiation and propagation of ICWs, the key intra- and extracellular messengers (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and ATP) mediating ICWs, and the proposed physiological functions of ICWs.},

abstract = {The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is only partially understood. $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) is physiologically generated by sequential cleavage of its precursor protein by the $\beta$- and the $\gamma$-secretase and it is normally disposed of. In Alzheimer's disease, A$\beta$ is excessively produced or less dismissed, but the hypothesis on its physiological and pathological role are heterogeneous and often discordant. It has been described a positive feedback loop from the $\gamma$- to the $\beta$-secretase cleavages of A$\beta$ precursor protein, which is activated by mutations of Presenilin 1 (PS1), the catalytic core of the $\gamma$-secretase. These findings show that A$\beta$ precursor protein as well the activity of the $\gamma$-secretase are required to obtain the up-regulation of $\beta$-secretase which is induced by Presenilin 1 mutations. Then, A$\beta$ 1-42 is the A$\beta$ precursor protein derivative that up-regulates the expression of $\beta$-secretase, and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun and ERK1/2 are involved. Here, we describe the activation of $\beta$-secretase and c-jun N-terminal kinase related proteins by monomeric A$\beta$ 1-42, defining the conditions that most efficiently strike the described signaling without producing toxicity. Taken together these data imply that monomeric A$\beta$ 1-42, at non-toxic concentrations and time frames, are able to induce a signaling pathway that leads to transcriptional activation of $\beta$-secretase.},

@article{Kapela2008,
abstract = {A mathematical model of calcium dynamics in vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) was developed based on data mostly from rat mesenteric arterioles. The model focuses on (a) the plasma membrane electrophysiology; (b) Ca2+ uptake and release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR); (c) cytosolic balance of Ca2+, Na+, K+, and Cl ions; and (d) IP3 and cGMP formation in response to norepinephrine(NE) and nitric oxide (NO) stimulation. Stimulation with NE induced membrane depolarization and an intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+i) transient followed by a plateau. The plateau concentrations were mostly determined by the activation of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. NE causes a greater increase in Ca2+i than stimulation with KCl to equivalent depolarization. Model simulations suggest that the effect ofNa+i accumulation on the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) can potentially account for this difference.Elevation of Ca2+i within a concentration window (150-300 nM) by NE or KCl initiated Ca2+i oscillations with a concentration-dependent period. The oscillations were generated by the nonlinear dynamics of Ca2+ release and refilling in the SR. NO repolarized the NE-stimulated SMC and restored low Ca2+i mainly through its effect on Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Under certain conditions, Na+-K+-ATPase inhibition can result in the elevation of Na+i and the reversal of NCX, increasing resting cytosolic and SR Ca2+ content, as well as reactivity to NE. Blockade of the NCX's reverse mode could eliminate these effects. We conclude that the integration of the selected cellular components yields a mathematical model that reproduces, satisfactorily, some of the established features of SMC physiology. Simulations suggest a potential role of intracellular Na+ in modulating Ca2+ dynamics and provide insights into the mechanisms of SMC constriction, relaxation, and the phenomenon of vasomotion. The model will provide the basis for the development of multi-cellular mathematical models that will investigate microcirculatory function in health and disease.},

abstract = {We developed a new technique to estimate the aortic pressure (AP) waveform from a single peripheral artery pressure (PAP) waveform. The technique 1) employs a parallel tube model of the arterial tree to establish a transfer function relating PAP to AP with unknown parameters; 2) estimates the parameters from the measured PAP waveform, along with a single non-invasive measurement of the wave transmission delay from the aorta to the peripheral artery measurement site, by exploiting the fact that aortic flow is zero during diastole; and 3) applies the transfer function to the PAP waveform to predict the unmeasured AP waveform. In this way, in contrast to the conventional generalized transfer function paradigm, the transfer function is able to adapt to the inter-subject and temporal variability of the arterial tree. We applied this adaptive transfer function technique to PAP waveforms measured from five dogs instrumented with reference AP catheters during various hemodynamic interventions. Our results showed that the technique was able to reliably estimate the AP waveform with an overall error of 4.2 mmHg. For comparison, the corresponding errors of two previously proposed generalized transfer functions trained on a subset of the same canine data were, on average, 19\% larger.},

abstract = {Neuronal activity in the brain is thought to be coupled to cerebral arterioles (functional hyperemia) through Ca2+ signals in astrocytes. Although functional hyperemia occurs rapidly, within seconds, such rapid signaling has not been demonstrated in situ, and Ca2+ measurements in parenchymal arterioles are still lacking. Using a laser scanning confocal microscope and fluorescence Ca2+ indicators, we provide the first evidence that in a brain slice preparation, increased neuronal activity by electrical stimulation (ES) is rapidly signaled, within seconds, to cerebral arterioles and is associated with astrocytic Ca2+ waves. Smooth muscle cells in parenchymal arterioles exhibited Ca2+ and diameter oscillations ("vasomotion") that were rapidly suppressed by ES. The neuronal-mediated Ca2+ rise in cortical astrocytes was dependent on intracellular (inositol trisphosphate [IP3]) and extracellular voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel sources. The Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin prevented the rise in astrocytic [Ca2+]i and the suppression of Ca2+ oscillations in parenchymal arterioles to ES, indicating that neuronal activity was necessary for both events. Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors in astrocytes significantly decreased the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations in parenchymal arterioles. This study supports the concept that astrocytic Ca2+ changes signal the cerebral microvasculature and indicate the novel concept that this communication occurs through the suppression of arteriolar [Ca2+]i oscillations and corresponding vasomotion.

abstract = {Prior 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) experiments, which simultaneously measured in vivo rates of total glutamate-glutamine cycling (V(cyc(tot))) and neuronal glucose oxidation (CMR(glc(ox), N)), revealed a linear relationship between these fluxes above isoelectricity, with a slope of approximately 1. In vitro glial culture studies examining glutamate uptake indicated that glutamate, which is cotransported with Na+, stimulated glial uptake of glucose and release of lactate. These in vivo and in vitro results were consolidated into a model: recycling of one molecule of neurotransmitter between glia and neurons was associated with oxidation of one glucose molecule in neurons; however, the glucose was taken up only by glia and all the lactate (pyruvate) generated by glial glycolysis was transferred to neurons for oxidation. The model was consistent with the 1:1 relationship between DeltaCMR(glc(ox), N) and DeltaV(cyc(tot)) measured by 13C MRS. However, the model could not specify the energetics of glia and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) neurons because quantitative values for these pathways were not available. Here, we review recent 13C and 14C tracer studies that enable us to include these fluxes in a more comprehensive model. The revised model shows that glia produce at least 8\% of total oxidative ATP and GABAergic neurons generate approximately 18\% of total oxidative ATP in neurons. Neurons produce at least 88\% of total oxidative ATP, and take up approximately 26\% of the total glucose oxidized. Glial lactate (pyruvate) still makes the major contribution to neuronal oxidation, but approximately 30\% less than predicted by the prior model. The relationship observed between DeltaCMR(glc(ox), N) and DeltaV(cyc(tot)) is determined by glial glycolytic ATP as before. Quantitative aspects of the model, which can be tested by experimentation, are discussed.},

abstract = {S100B is an EF-hand calcium-binding protein that exerts both intracellular and extracellular effects on a variety of cellular processes. The protein is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system by astrocytes, both physiologically and during the course of neurological disease. In the healthy adult brain and during development, constitutive S100B expression acts as a trophic factor to drive neurite extension and to referee neuroplasticity. Yet, when induced during central nervous system disease, the protein can take on maladaptive roles and thereby exacerbate brain pathology. Based on genetic and pharmacological lines of evidence, we consider such deleterious roles of S100B in two common brain pathologies: ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In rodent models of ischemic brain damage, S100B is induced early on during the subacute phase, where it exacerbates gliosis and delayed infarct expansion and thereby worsens functional recovery. In mouse models of AD, S100B drives brain inflammation and gliosis that accelerate cerebral amyloidosis. Pharmacological inhibition of S100B synthesis mitigates hallmark pathologies of both brain diseases, opening the door for translational approaches to treat these devastating neurological disorders.},

abstract = {Increasing evidence supports a crucial role for glial metabolism in maintaining proper synaptic function and in the etiology of neurological disease. However, the study of glial metabolism in humans has been hampered by the lack of noninvasive methods. To specifically measure the contribution of astroglia to brain energy metabolism in humans, we used a novel noninvasive nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic approach. We measured carbon 13 incorporation into brain glutamate and glutamine in eight volunteers during an intravenous infusion of [2-13C] acetate, which has been shown in animal models to be metabolized specifically in astroglia. Mathematical modeling of the three established pathways for neurotransmitter glutamate repletion indicates that the glutamate/glutamine neurotransmitter cycle between astroglia and neurons (0.32 +/- 0.07 micromol x gm(-1) x min(-1)) is the major pathway for neuronal glutamate repletion and that the astroglial TCA cycle flux (0.14 +/- 0.06 micromol x gm(-1) x min(-1)) accounts for approximately 14\% of brain oxygen consumption. Up to 30\% of the glutamine transferred to the neurons by the cycle may derive from replacement of oxidized glutamate by anaplerosis. The further application of this approach could potentially enlighten the role of astroglia in supporting brain glutamatergic activity and in neurological and psychiatric disease.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is a new intercellular messenger that occurs naturally in the brain without causing overt toxicity. Yet, NO has been implicated as a mediator of cell death in cell death. One explanation is that ischemia causes overproduction of NO, allowing it to react with superoxide to form the potent oxidant peroxynitrite. To address this question, we used immunohistochemistry for citrulline, a marker for NO synthase activity, and 3-nitrotyrosine, a marker for peroxynitrite formation, in mice subjected to reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion. We show that ischemia triggers a marked augmentation in citrulline immunoreactivity but more so in the peri-infarct than the infarcted tissue. This increase is attributable to the activation of a large population (approximately 80\%) of the neuronal isoform of NO synthase (nNOS) that is catalytically inactive during basal conditions, indicating a tight regulation of physiological NO production in the brain. In contrast, 3-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity is restricted to the infarcted tissue and is not present in the peri-infarct tissue. In nNOS(Delta/Delta) mice, known to be protected against ischemia, no 3-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity is detected. Our findings provide a cellular localization for nNOS activation in association with ischemic stroke and establish that NO is not likely a direct neurotoxin, whereas its conversion to peroxynitrite is associated with cell death.},

abstract = {Thrombin has been found in neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Also, traumatic brain injury, where neurons are exposed to high thrombin levels, is associated with an increased incidence of AD. Our objective was to determine the effects of thrombin administered in vivo on cognitive function and neuropathology. Rats were trained using a radial eight-arm maze and then thrombin (25 or 100 nM, 0.25 microl/h, 28 days) or vehicle was delivered via intracerebroventricular infusion. Animals that received 100 nM thrombin demonstrated cognitive impairments including deficits in reference memory and an increase in task latency. Also, significant neuropathology was detected in these animals such as enlargement of cerebral ventricles, an increased number of TUNEL-positive cells, astrogliosis, and an increase in the immunoreactivity for phosphorylated neurofilament, and apolipoprotein-E fragments. Thrombin-induced changes in cognitive function and ventricular enlargement were inhibited by hirudin. These findings demonstrate that thrombin is a mediator of neurotoxicity and cognitive deficits and suggest that inhibition of thrombin may be a treatment strategy for AD- or head trauma-associated cognitive deficits.},

abstract = {Neuronal activity evokes localized changes in blood flow. Although this response, termed neurovascular coupling, is widely used to monitor human brain function and diagnose pathology, the cellular mechanisms that mediate the response remain unclear. We investigated the contribution of glial cells to neurovascular coupling in the acutely isolated mammalian retina. We found that light stimulation and glial cell stimulation can both evoke dilation or constriction of arterioles. Light-evoked and glial-evoked vasodilations were blocked by inhibitors of cytochrome P450 epoxygenase, the synthetic enzyme for epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. Vasoconstrictions, in contrast, were blocked by an inhibitor of omega-hydroxylase, which synthesizes 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Nitric oxide influenced whether vasodilations or vasoconstrictions were produced in response to light and glial stimulation. Light-evoked vasoactivity was blocked when neuron-to-glia signaling was interrupted by a purinergic antagonist. These results indicate that glial cells contribute to neurovascular coupling and suggest that regulation of blood flow may involve both vasodilating and vasoconstricting components.},

The NVU controls blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and cerebral blood flow, and maintains the chemical composition of the neuronal 'milieu', which is required for proper functioning of neuronal circuits. Recent evidence indicates that BBB dysfunction is associated with the accumulation of several vasculotoxic and neurotoxic molecules within brain parenchyma, a reduction in cerebral blood flow, and hypoxia. Together, these vascular-derived insults might initiate and/or contribute to neuronal degeneration. This article examines mechanisms of BBB dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders, notably Alzheimer's disease, and highlights therapeutic opportunities relating to these neurovascular deficits.},
